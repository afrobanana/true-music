# ALEX TOMB

![](./assets/images/ALEXTOMB.png)

A regular behind the decks at Klubd and Ithaki Beach Bar in Cyprus, and Griessmuehle Spirograph in Berlin, Alex Tomb takes listeners on a trip through multi-layered basslines and minimal and mysterious melodies. Since he bought his first turntables at the age of 16, Alex Tombâ€™s meticulously structured sets, are now easily recognisable thanks to his unique techno and dark techno sounds, and experimental grooves, hypnotising the crowds long into the night.
