A serious player on the underground music scene since 2011, Aristodemos has a reputation for concise and on point, cross-genre sets. Whether he is selecting funk and disco rarities in sexy cocktail spots; grooving to house classics at major beach bars or piling on the pressure with ravey breaks in dark clubs, this DJ and co-founder of Honest Electronics plays at all the major festivals and key events on the island.
