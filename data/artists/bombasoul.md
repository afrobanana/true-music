# Bombasoul

![](./assets/images/sample.png)

To Bombasoul, music is art that should expand the mind and spirit, and if it pushes the boundaries then this veteran DJ is into it. His diverse musical taste is reflected in his ever-evolving sets, which having dipped into deep funk, jazz mutations, disco, soul, bass, house, techno, now lean towards deeper Afro inspired beats ranging from funk and disco to house and bass driven rhythms.
