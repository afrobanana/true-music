Savvas Fanti – or Fantis as he is known on the DJ circuit – is an up and coming force in ‘clubland’ on the island. Equally as comfortable playing hard techno in sweaty clubs, as he is spinning swanky house beats at trendy cocktail bars, Fantis’ uncompromising sound and unique mixing technique encompasses techno, progressive, house and dance music.
