# Geechemist

![](./assets/images/sample.png)

Romina Oikonomidou’s music has the kinetic soundscape of a dark optimistic dystopia within the downtempo spectrum. Also known as Geechemis, this eclectic DJ with an underground dark-rock attitude appreciates a badass bassline – and her sets take audiences on a multi-dimensional psychedelic journey through nostalgic 90s leftfield sounds, with 70s funky elements, soulful hinges and global dubby beats.
