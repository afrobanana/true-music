Music came as second nature to Constantina Apostolescu (aka INA) who spent her childhood surrounded by cassette culture and dance radio and was exposed to classic records and smooth vinyl tracks before she could even talk. Once she stepped behind the decks, the emphasis of her unpredictable sets was on 90s house, minimal, groovy UKG and touches of electro.
