A music aficionado, obsessive record collector, producer, promoter, co-founder of Disco Dystopia events and owner of Sousami Bar in Limassol, Mr. Fox is one of the major players on the emerging underground DJ scene in Cyprus. As a performer, he has honed his skills by mixing predominantly with vinyl, while his ever-growing passion for music also lead him to write and produce his own tracks for several projects.
