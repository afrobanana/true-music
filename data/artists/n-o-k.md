NOK is a real smooth groover, whose sultry sound travels through the realms of soul, jazz, blues and funk. With a burgeoning DJ career born out of personal musical mood swings, this tuned-in talent combines different moods across the funk and house spectrum. Currently obsessed with Arabic funk, NOK is also influenced by the rich cultures and heady beats of Africa, Turkey, Brazil and Japan.
