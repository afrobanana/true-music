# Break-Beat

Breakbeat is an umbrella term to describe a broader collection of Electronic or Dance music characterised by its use of breaks. Breaks are otherwise known as the part of a track where the melody breaks to let the drummer or bassist play solo. This genre typically replaces the thumping ‘four on the floor’ bassline with intensive syncopation and poly rhythms.
