# Disco

Named after the French word for the dance clubs that first emerged in the 1960s, disco music was always intended to be danced to. An upbeat incorporation of soul, funk, pop, Motown and even salsa, the genre developed in the 60s, had become a phenomenon by the 70s and was an important precursor to the club music of the 90s.
