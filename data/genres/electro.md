# Electro

Characterised by the drum machines that form the rhythmic basis of the tracks and helped define the genre, Electro is an electronic music style that is sometimes dubbed the earliest form of Hip Hop. Emerging as a result of the decline of disco in the late-1970s, Electro uses heavier, more distinctive beats, usually without vocals.
