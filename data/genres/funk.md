# Funk

Originating in the mid-1960s, funk music was the result of African American musicians like the legendary James Brown, developing a more rhythmic style of groove that combined soul, jazz and R&B. This new style was highly danceable in nature, emphasising rhythm over melody, with the bass guitar as the prominent instrument.
