# Hip Hop

More than just a music genre, Hip Hop also became an underground cultural movement amongst African Americans and Latino Americans in the 1970s. First emerging at block parties in the Bronx in New York, the genre combines stylised rhythmic music with rapped vocals which often protested the legal institutionsâ€™ treatment of minorities in the US.
