# House

Since the early 80s when it first came about, house music has become the key ingredient of modern club music as we know it. Named after the legendary Warehouse club in Chicago, the genre evolved out of studio experiments with new technology by DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy. Soul, funk and disco all influence the genre.
