# Leftfield House

Less of a stand-alone genre and more a catchall term for the unconventional and non-
conforming, Leftfield House refers to any genre-defying, experimental house music, usually with
an element of underground ‘quirkiness’. No single sound typifies the category; however it often
feature acid elements, wavy seapunk references and vaporwave vibes.
