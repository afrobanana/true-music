# New Wave

In the late 70s and the early 80s, a new wave of non-mainstream musicians began to emerge,
shifting away from the blues and classic or progressive rock, incorporating a plethora of diverse
new influences from across the early punk, dub reggae, funk, art rock, glam pop, kraut rock and
experimental electronic music spectrums.
