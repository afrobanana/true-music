# Post Punk

Emerging in the 70s as a progression of punk rock, post-punk maintains the energy and DIY ethic
of its predecessor, while introducing avant-garde and experimental elements. Influenced by
electronic music, funk, disco, dub and free jazz, post-punk was also characterised by innovative
recording and production, and strong ties to modernist art, politics, critical theory and literature.
