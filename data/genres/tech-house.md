# Tech House

Tech House is the marriage of Techno and House music. The subgenre takes the basic structure of House, replacing the Jazz sounds or thumping kick-drums with more traditionally Techno sounds such as noisier snares shorter, deeper, darker and often distorted kicks, more synthetic or acid sounding synth melodies and smaller, quicker hi-hats.
