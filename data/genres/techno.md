# Techno

Techno emerged in Detroit and Michigan in the mid-1980s at a time when futuristic fiction was popular. This infiltrated the style in the shape of repetitive beats and science-fiction themes, which merged with African American influences such as house, funk and electronic sounds. In the late 80s the genre came to Europe and was a huge part of club culture and the rave scene.
